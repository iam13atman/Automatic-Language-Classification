The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place .,en,en,en
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee  which had over-all charge of the election  `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted .,en,en,en
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. .,np,en,en
`` Only a relative handful of such reports was received ''  the jury said  `` considering the widespread interest in the election  the number of voters and the size of this city '' .,en,en,en
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' .,en,en,en
It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' .,en,en,en
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics  among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' .,en,en,en
However  the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' .,en,en,en
The City Purchasing Department  the jury said  `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' .,en,en,en
It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem .,en,en,en
Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury .,en,en,en
It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' .,en,en,en
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes .,en,en,en
`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program ''  the jury said  but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County  which receives none of this money .,en,en,en
The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' .,en,en,en
Nevertheless  `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds ''  the jurors said .,en,en,en
`` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers .,en,en,en
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers  guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation .,np,en,en
The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries  the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee .,en,en,en
`` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms ''  the jury said .,en,en,en
Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport  the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' .,np,en,en
The jury did not elaborate  but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' .,en,en,en
Ask jail deputies,en,np2,en
On other matters  the jury recommended that : ( 1 ),en,en,en
Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor  medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' .,en,en,en
Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes .,en,en,en
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department  the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office  the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms  Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department .,en,en,en
Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife  Pearl Williams Hartsfield  in Fulton Superior Court Friday .,en,en,en
His petition charged mental cruelty .,en,np2,en
The couple was married Aug. 2  1913 .,en,en,en
They have a son  William Berry Jr.  and a daughter  Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin .,en,en,en
Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon .,en,en,en

Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race  a top official said Wednesday .,en,en,en
Robert Snodgrass  state GOP chairman  said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience .,np,en,en
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker .,en,en,en
In the Blue Ridge meeting  the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters .,en,en,en
Despite the warning  there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate  according to Republicans who attended .,en,en,en
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race  it voted no -- and there were no dissents .,en,en,en
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race  one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1,en,en,en
Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot  or 2,en,en,en
The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform .,en,en,en

The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly .,en,en,en
Before adjournment Monday afternoon  the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made .,en,en,en
Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment .,en,en,en
Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item .,en,en,en
Meanwhile  it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds .,en,en,en
The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act  and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways .,en,en,en
A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work .,en,en,en
A revolving fund,en,np2,en
The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities .,en,en,en
Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin .,en,en,en
The Highway Department source told The Constitution  however  that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds .,en,en,en
Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances .,en,en,en
Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought .,en,en,en
While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out  Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 .,en,en,en
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5 .,en,en,en
As of Sunday night  there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action .,en,en,en
Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions .,en,en,en
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education  something it has consistently opposed in the past .,en,en,en
Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education  provided that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds .,en,en,en
Barber  who is in his 13th year as a legislator  said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' .,en,en,en
But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution .,en,en,en
The resolution  which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday  will be formally read Monday .,en,en,en
It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds ''  the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises .,en,en,en
-- After a long  hot controversy  Miller County has a new school superintendent  elected  as a policeman put it  in the `` coolest election I ever saw in this county '' .,en,en,en
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis  a veteran agriculture teacher  who defeated Felix Bush  a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee .,en,en,en
Davis received 1119 votes in Saturday's election  and Bush got 402 .,en,en,en
Ordinary Carey Williams  armed with a pistol  stood by at the polls to insure order .,en,en,en
`` This was the coolest  calmest election I ever saw ''  Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said .,en,en,en
`` Being at the polls was just like being at church .,en,en,en
I didn't smell a drop of liquor  and we didn't have a bit of trouble '' .,en,en,en
The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet  however .,en,en,en
It was marked by controversy  anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence .,np,en,en
The former county school superintendent  George P. Callan  shot himself to death March 18  four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board .,en,en,en
During the election campaign  both candidates  Davis and Bush  reportedly received anonymous telephone calls .,np,en,en
Ordinary Williams said he  too  was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election .,np,en,en
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls  and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election .,en,en,en
Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise .,en,en,en
`` Everything went real smooth ''  the sheriff said .,en,en,en
`` There wasn't a bit of trouble '' .,en,en,en
Austin  Texas,en,en,en
-- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers .,en,en,en
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure  which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures  in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation .,en,en,en
Under committee rules  it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week .,en,en,en
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it .,en,en,en
Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 .,en,en,en
He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' .,en,en,en
It permits the state to take over bank accounts  stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more .,en,en,en
The bill  which Daniel said he drafted personally  would force banks  insurance firms  pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer .,en,en,en
The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property  Daniel declared .,en,en,en
Dewey Lawrence  a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association  sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers .,en,en,en
`` If you destroy confidence in banks  you do something to the economy ''  he said .,en,en,en
`` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' .,en,en,en
Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman  sponsor of the bill  said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks  insurance and pipeline companies '' .,en,en,en
His contention was denied by several bankers  including Scott Hudson of Sherman  Gaynor B. Jones of Houston  J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin .,en,en,en
Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since  he said  it would impair contracts .,en,en,en
He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing  since the bill was introduced only last Monday .,en,en,en
Austin  Texas,en,en,en
-- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties .,en,en,en
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state .,en,en,en
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House .,en,en,en
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population  require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools  permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here .,en,en,en
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas  Harris  Bexar  Tarrant and El Paso would be $451500  which would be a savings of $157460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88000 was absorbed  Parkhouse told the Senate .,en,en,en
The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County  saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school .,en,en,en
Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff .,en,en,en
While details are still to be worked out  Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected .,en,en,en
`` We're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting ''  said Ratcliff .,en,en,en
`` But I believe if people were better informed on this question  most of them would oppose it also .,en,en,en
I'm willing to stake my political career on it '' .,en,en,en
Rep. Berry  an ex-gambler from San Antonio  got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies .,en,en,en
A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report  although the resolution faces hard sledding later .,en,en,en
The house passed finally  and sent to the Senate  a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities .,en,en,en
The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees  passing the three on the calendar .,en,en,en
One validated acts of school districts .,en,en,en
Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District .,en,en,en
The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District  for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted .,en,en,en
Without dissent  senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district .,en,en,en
Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site .,en,en,en
Two tax revision bills were passed .,en,en,en
One  by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba  would aid more than 17000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized .,en,en,en
Instead  retailers would sign a certificate of correctness  violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison  plus a $1000 fine .,en,en,en
It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League .,en,en,en
The other bill  by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris  would relieve real estate brokers  who pay their own annual licensing fee  from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds .,en,en,en
Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain  under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3  of El Paso  to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas .,en,en,en
Marshall Formby of Plainview  former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission  suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress  eliminating the need for costly special elections .,en,en,en
Under Formby's plan  an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor  lieutenant governor  speaker of the House  attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court .,en,en,en
Austin  Texas,en,en,en
-- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay .,en,en,en
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot  when Texas votes on a U.S. senator .,en,en,en
Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole  sponsor of the poll idea  said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill .,en,en,en
The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 .,en,en,en
The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval  by two-thirds majorities  before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot  Roberts said .,en,en,en
Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice .,en,en,en
All Dallas members voted with Roberts  except Rep. Bill Jones  who was absent .,en,en,en
Austin  Texas,en,en,en
-- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday .,en,en,en
Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise  a Wise County hamlet of 250 people .,en,en,en
When the shouting ended  the bill passed  114 to 4  sending it to the Senate  where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas .,en,en,en
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse .,en,en,en
The bill would increase from $5000000 to $15000000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project .,en,en,en
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas .,en,en,en
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds  and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill  did not sway Cotten's attack .,en,en,en
The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas  Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission  Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs .,en,en,en
`` This is a poor boy's bill ''  said Chapman .,en,en,en
`` Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds .,en,en,en
This would help the little peanut districts '' .,en,en,en
Austin  Texas,en,en,en
-- A Houston teacher  now serving in the Legislature  proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' .,en,en,en
Rep. Henry C. Grover  who teaches history in the Houston public schools  would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate .,en,en,en
A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours .,en,en,en
Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching .,en,en,en
The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects .,en,en,en
`` A person with a master's degree in physics  chemistry  math or English  yet who has not taken Education courses  is not permitted to teach in the public schools ''  said Grover .,np,en,en

State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon '' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program .,en,en,en
The report  culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm  listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load .,en,en,en
The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown  desertion  and ADC dependency '' .,en,en,en
`` Must solve problem '',en,np2,en
The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars  said C. Virgil Martin  president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co.  committee chairman .,en,en,en
`` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence ''  Martin said .,en,en,en
The volume of ADC cases will decrease  Martin reported  when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color .,en,en,en
These  he said  are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' .,en,en,en
Calls for extension,np,en,en
Other recommendations made by the committee are :,en,en,en

Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest  Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday .,en,en,en
The disclosure by Charles Bellows  chief defense counsel  startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial .,en,en,en
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client  Alan Clements  30  a separate trial .,en,en,en
Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom .,en,en,en
Fears prejudicial aspects,en,np2,en
`` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client ''  Bellows told the court .,en,en,en
`` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property .,en,en,en
It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others '' .,en,en,en
Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired  `` You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this '' ? ?,en,en,en
`` Yes  your honor ''  replied Bellows .,en,en,en
`` What this amounts to  if true  is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case .,en,en,en
There is a conflict among the defendants '' .,en,en,en
Washington  July 24,en,en,en
-- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio .,en,en,en
The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone .,en,en,en
Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port  Mass.  a White House spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go '' toward completion .,en,en,en
Decisions are made,en,en,en
Asked to elaborate  Pierre Salinger  White House press secretary  replied  `` I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts '' .,en,en,en
Salinger said the work President Kennedy  advisers  and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording  rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city .,en,en,en
The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns  who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means '' .,en,en,en
Karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence '' of the 50 persons .,en,en,en
He said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens '' .,en,en,en
Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases .,en,en,en
In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case '' .,en,en,en
Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler  special prosecutor .,en,en,en
Issue jury subpoenas,en,np2,en
Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation  questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building  but did not take them before the grand jury .,en,en,en
Mayer Goldberg  attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward  argued this procedure constituted intimidation .,en,en,en
Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning .,en,en,en
Karns said it was a `` wrongful act '' for Wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room '' .,en,en,en
He said this constituted a `` very serious misuse '' of the Criminal court processes .,en,en,en
`` Actually  the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county  altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court ''  said Karns  who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court .,en,en,en
Faced seven cases,en,en,en
Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons .,en,en,en
Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary '' miscount of the vote  in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another .,en,en,en
The cases involved judges in the 33d  24th  and 42d precincts of the 31st ward  the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward  the 18th precinct of the 4th ward  and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward .,en,en,en
The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns .,en,en,en
Two other cases also were under advisement .,en,en,en
Claims precedent lacking,en,np2,en
After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case  Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed  he would dismiss them .,en,en,en
Washington  Feb. 9,en,en,en
-- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs .,en,en,en
The President  in a special message to Congress  tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships  build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools  and expand child health care and general medical research .,en,en,en
The aged care plan  similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator  a fight on Capitol hill .,en,en,en
It was defeated in Congress last year .,en,en,en
Cost up to $37 a year,en,en,en
It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes .,en,en,en
The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4800 of pay per year .,en,en,en
The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each .,en,en,en
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system .,en,en,en
The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1  1963  if the plan is approved  because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs .,en,en,en
Outlays would increase,en,en,en
Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year  1963 .,en,en,en
Both figures would go higher in later years .,en,en,en
Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years .,en,en,en
These would be paid for out of general  not payroll  taxes .,en,en,en
Nursing home care,en,en,en
The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1,en,en,en
Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness  except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days .,en,en,en
Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital .,en,en,en
A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula '' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit .,en,en,en
Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient .,en,en,en
Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness .,en,en,en
The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged .,en,en,en
Calls proposal modest,np,np2,en
He said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense  but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay '' .,en,en,en
`` This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs ''  he said  `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals .,en,en,en
`` This is not a program of socialized medicine .,en,en,en
It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed .,en,en,en
Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital '' .,en,en,en
Wouldn't pay doctors,en,en,en
The plan does not cover doctor bills .,en,en,en
They would still be paid by the patient .,en,en,en
Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships  and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools .,en,en,en
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care .,en,en,en
Moreover  he said  many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs .,en,en,en
Contributions to schools,en,en,en
The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students .,en,en,en
The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships  based on need  of up to $2000 a year per student .,en,en,en
In addition  the government would pay a $1000 `` cost of education '' grant to the schools for each $1500 in scholarship grants .,en,en,en
Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 .,en,en,en
The President recommended federal `` matching grants '' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones .,en,en,en
More for nursing homes,en,en,en
In the area of `` community health services ''  the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction .,en,en,en
He asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial '' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants '' to states to improve nursing homes .,en,en,en
He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals .,en,en,en
In the child health field  the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau .,en,en,en
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute .,en,en,en
Asks research funds,en,np2,en
The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation .,en,en,en
He did not say by how much .,en,en,en
For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase  from 30 to 50 millions  in matching grants for building research facilities .,en,en,en
The President said he will also propose increasing  by an unspecified amount  the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine .,en,en,en
The President said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people  knowledge  services  facilities  and the means to pay for them '' .,en,en,en
Reaction as expected,en,en,en
Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines .,en,en,en
Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan .,en,en,en
Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message .,en,en,en
Senate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance .,en,en,en
Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first .,en,en,en
House Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D.  Tex. ) called the Kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing ''  but made no prediction on its fate in the House .,en,en,en
Washington  Feb. 9,en,en,en
-- Acting hastily under White House pressure  the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief .,en,en,en
Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote .,en,en,en
A number of scattered `` ayes '' and `` noes '' was heard .,en,en,en
Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency .,en,en,en
In the last eight years  all Presidential appointments  including those of cabinet rank  have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor .,en,en,en
Enforce by demand,en,en,en
The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D.  Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 .,en,en,en
The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer  franker  and wider discussions  animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings .,en,en,en
This has been a working session of an organization that  by its very nature  can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes .,en,en,en
In Oslo  the ministers have met in a climate of candor  and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems .,en,en,en
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never  or not for a long time  had such problems .,en,en,en
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa  exacerbated by the difficulties  changes  and tragedies facing them  and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about  has been conspicuous by its absence .,en,en,en
In the case of Portugal  which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh  there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension .,en,en,en
The general  remarkably courteous  explanation has left basic positions unchanged  but there has been no explosion in the council .,en,en,en
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes  since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance .,en,en,en
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive .,en,en,en
Even Norway  despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance  is today closer to the NATO line .,en,en,en
On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for .,en,en,en
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as `` inconclusive '' .,en,en,en
But he hastened to add that  if United States policies were not always clear  despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West  this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy .,en,en,en
A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair  with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited .,en,en,en
The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days  despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity  that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind  more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots .,en,en,en
The Secretary of State himself  in his first speech  gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months .,en,en,en
But where the core of NATO is concerned  the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance  `` cornerstone '' of its foreign policy  but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters .,en,en,en
The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin  an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole .,en,en,en
The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction  wherever it take place around the globe  is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies  and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection .,en,en,en
The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more  deeper  and more timely political consultation within the alliance  the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries  and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent .,en,en,en
This increase in the `` threshold ''  as the conventional forces strengthening is called  will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come .,en,en,en
Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down  but never completely fulfilled .,en,en,en
The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time .,en,en,en
There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos .,en,en,en
The United States  State Department officials explain  now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam .,en,en,en
They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this .,en,en,en
The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated .,en,en,en
But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility .,en,en,en
The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos  rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference .,en,en,en
This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make .,en,en,en
It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration .,en,en,en
Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas .,en,en,en
But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises :,en,en,en
How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ? ?,en,en,en
Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union .,en,en,en
He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory .,en,en,en
It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it .,en,en,en
They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans  if they had been in power  would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders '' in Cuba .,en,en,en
One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score .,en,en,en
His reply  he said  was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now .,en,en,en
But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first .,en,en,en
The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky  chairman of the Republican National Committee  that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination .,en,en,en
Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard  Boston University  Brandeis  and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators .,en,en,en
This group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups '' .,en,en,en
It recommends that the United States `` seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; ;,en,en,en
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds '' .,en,en,en
Mr. Nixon  for his part  would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation .,en,en,en
But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated .,en,en,en
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos  almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected  generally  the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors .,en,en,en
Aid plans revamped,en,np2,en
Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels  a high official source disclosed  that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration .,en,en,en
Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements .,en,en,en
Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed .,en,en,en
But thus far there has been no response in kind .,en,en,en
Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations .,en,en,en
In Laos  the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture .,en,en,en
Again and again it asked the Communists to `` freeze '' the military situation in Laos .,en,en,en
But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate .,en,en,en
And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up  administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service '' and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization .,en,en,en
SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos .,en,en,en
But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos .,en,en,en
( Some SEATO nations disagreed  however .,en,en,en
There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally  unlike its more determined neighbors  Thailand and South Viet Nam .,en,en,en
The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos .,en,en,en
The pro-Western government  which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma `` neutralist '' government  never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army .,en,en,en
There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt .,en,en,en
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma  whom it felt was too trusting of Communists  it gradually had to relinquish them .,en,en,en
One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .,en,en,en
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal '' of Prince Souvanna .,en,en,en
The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States .,en,en,en
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation '' .,en,en,en
In an important assertion of national leadership in this field  he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime  to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems .,en,en,en
The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend .,en,en,en
The President has also called upon the Attorney General  the Secretary of Health  Education and Welfare  and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem .,en,en,en
Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett  a special assistant to the Attorney General  as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime .,en,en,en
His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948  each year showing an increase in offenders .,en,en,en
Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959  about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age .,en,en,en
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director  Raymond H. Hawksley  the present city CD head  believes .,en,en,en
Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time .,en,en,en
East Providence now has no civil defense program .,en,en,en
Mr. Hawksley  the state's general treasurer  has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years .,en,en,en
He is not interested in being named a full-time director .,en,en,en
Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program  Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director .,en,en,en
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs .,en,en,en
Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job .,en,en,en
One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin  he said .,en,en,en
Along with a director  the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized .,en,en,en
Mr. Hawksley said .,en,en,en
One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director  he said  is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program .,en,en,en
Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios  sirens and rescue trucks  he said .,en,en,en
Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks  similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station .,en,en,en
He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area .,en,en,en
Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city  Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack .,en,en,en
The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point  he said  and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another .,np,en,en
Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point .,en,en,en
Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack .,en,en,en
Such vital information  he said  has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know .,en,en,en
If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director  Mr. Hawksley said  then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally .,np,en,en
One of the first things he would do  he said  would be to organize classes in first aid .,en,en,en
Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government .,en,en,en
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind .,en,en,en
Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly .,en,en,en
The governor's move into the so-called `` blue law '' controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant  deputy city clerk of Central Falls .,en,en,en
A copy was released to the press .,np,en,en
Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant .,en,en,en
The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature .,en,en,en
While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review  Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get `` the benefit of his views '' .,en,en,en
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation  the governor said .,en,en,en
`` I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings ''  Mr. Notte said  `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious  labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws '' .,en,en,en
The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales '' .,en,en,en
The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws .,en,en,en
Should there be evidence they are shirking  he has said  the state police will step into the situation .,en,en,en
There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws .,en,en,en
The statutes  similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times  severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath .,en,en,en
The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday .,np,en,en
The only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday ''  the council's resolution said .,en,en,en
The small shops `` must be retained  for they provide essential service to the community ''  according to the resolution  which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors '' .,en,en,en
It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue '' to the local government .,en,en,en
The council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets  factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business '' on Sunday .,np,en,en
They `` operate on a volume basis ''  it was contended  `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community '' .,en,en,en
Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties  George H. Reama  nationally known labor-management expert  said here yesterday .,en,en,en
Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare '' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system .,en,en,en
He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day .,en,en,en
He said he was `` confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 '' .,en,en,en
That  he added  was when he was `` a very young man  a machinist and toolmaker by trade .,en,en,en
`` That was before I studied law .,en,en,en
Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party .,en,en,en
The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track .,en,en,en
He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track '' .,en,en,en
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910  the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources .,en,en,en
He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory  most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties .,en,en,en
Mr. Reama  who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said  `` Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it '' .,en,en,en
He said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze '' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices  he added .,en,en,en
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy  Mr. Reama said : `` A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own '' .,en,en,en
Mr. Reama  far from really being retired  is engaged in industrial relations counseling .,en,en,en
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town .,en,en,en
William A. Martinelli  chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston  transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr. .,en,en,en
The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post .,en,en,en
Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days .,en,en,en
He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work .,en,en,en
A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier  town solicitor  over the exact manner in which the vote is handled .,en,en,en
Mr. Martinelli has  in recent weeks  been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote  while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead .,en,en,en
Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures .,en,en,en
He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible .,en,en,en
Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement .,en,en,en
He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present  but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes .,en,en,en
`` After inspiring this  I think we should certainly follow through on it ''  he declared .,en,en,en
`` It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement '' .,en,en,en
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission .,en,en,en
`` Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement ''  he indicated  `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town '' .,en,en,en
He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September .,np,en,en
Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday  with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter .,en,en,en
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks  it was indicated .,en,en,en
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses '' .,en,en,en
Several signers affixed their names  it was learned  after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system .,en,en,en
Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting .,en,en,en
Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance .,en,en,en
At the last session of the General Assembly  the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective .,en,en,en
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation .,en,en,en
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition .,en,en,en
Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense .,en,en,en
-- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen  last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes  Democratic gubernatorial candidate  that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' .,en,en,en
Mitchell was for using it  Jones against  and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel .,en,en,en
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club .,en,en,en
It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs .,np,en,en
Hughes said Monday  `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism  but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired .,en,en,en
Now he's gone  the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' .,en,en,en
Sunday he had added  `` We can love Eisenhower the man  even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership '' .,en,en,en
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign .,en,en,en
`` How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? ?,en,en,en
He asked .,en,en,en
The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy '' while working in his adminstration .,en,en,en
Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue .,en,en,en
Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president .,en,en,en
`` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign ''  he said  `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign '' .,en,en,en
The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark .,en,en,en
Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary .,en,en,en
He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign .,en,en,en
State aid to schools  the continuance of railroad passenger service  the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority  and making New Jersey attractive to new industry .,en,en,en
Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate `` Must share the blame for this '' .,en,en,en
Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant  he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform .,en,en,en
`` But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time ''  Mitchell said .,en,en,en
Jones  unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions  saved his barbs for Mitchell .,en,en,en
He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises .,en,en,en
`` He calls for help while saying he is against centralization  but you can't have it both ways ''  Jones said .,np,en,en
The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities  real estate or motor vehicles  he said  `` and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue '' .,en,en,en
Earlier  Mitchell said in a statement :,en,en,en
`` I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes .,en,en,en
His reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history  to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States  and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations .,en,en,en
`` I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste .,en,en,en
`` Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature .,en,en,en
It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit '' .,en,en,en
Sees Jones ahead,en,np2,en
Sen. Charles W. Sandman  R-Cape May  said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination .,en,en,en
Sandman  state campaign chairman for Jones  was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel  Newark  of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones .,en,en,en
Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years .,en,en,en
Sandman said : `` The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj  has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway .,en,en,en
It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems .,en,en,en
`` We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington .,en,en,en
That failed .,en,en,en
`` We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year .,en,en,en
That  too  will fail '' .,en,en,en
Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave.  Westfield  as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee .,en,en,en
Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman .,en,en,en
County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets  who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination  today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them .,en,en,en
The proposal  Sheets said  represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a `` lip service word '' .,en,en,en
Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines  enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge .,en,en,en
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January  1964 .,en,en,en
Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful  he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines .,en,en,en
The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange  for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County  was supported today by Edward W. Roos  West Orange public safety commissioner .,en,en,en
Sheeran  a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization's candidate  Freeholder William MacDonald  for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy  now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals .,en,en,en
`` My experience as public safety commissioner ''  Roos said  `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience  and preferably one who is a lawyer .,en,en,en
Jim Sheeran fits that description '' .,en,en,en
-- William J. Seidel  state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development  has retired after 36 years of service .,en,en,en
A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state .,en,en,en
Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies .,en,en,en
In October 1944  he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section .,en,en,en
Under his supervision  the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting .,en,en,en
He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station .,en,en,en
He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens .,en,en,en
He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education .,en,en,en
-- Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state '' .,en,en,en
He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : `` When I come back here after the November election you'll think  ' You're my man -- you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected ' '' .,en,en,en
He said  `` We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just  and not what is expedient at the time '' .,en,en,en
In his only attack on the Republicans  Hughes said  `` The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary .,en,en,en
But we'll have a liberal  well planned  forward looking  honest platform .,en,en,en
We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson .,en,en,en
`` We'll take the truth to the people  and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November '' .,en,en,en
He said  `` You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration .,en,en,en
But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead '' .,en,en,en
He urged New Jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy '' .,en,en,en
He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states  and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry .,en,en,en
`` We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean ''  the former Superior Court judge said .,en,en,en
`` To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s '' .,en,en,en
Calling the Democrats the `` party that lives  breathes and thinks for the good of the people ''  Hughes asked  `` a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November '' .,en,en,en
Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's `` Green Acres '' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development .,en,en,en
He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday .,en,en,en
The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state .,en,en,en
The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis .,en,en,en
Hughes said  `` This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it ''  pointing out the state population has increased 125000 each year since 1950 .,en,en,en
He said `` Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas  there will be no land left to preserve '' .,en,en,en
Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved .,en,en,en
He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans .,en,en,en
`` After the primary ''  he promised  `` I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong  dynamic administration .,en,en,en
I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee '' .,en,en,en
-- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues .,en,en,en
The outgoing members  whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election  received carved wooden elephants  complete with ivory tusks  to remember the state committee by .,en,en,en
There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18  but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters .,en,en,en
A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank  who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee .,en,en,en
She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment .,en,en,en
She served one four-year term on the national committee .,en,en,en
Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates .,en,en,en
At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable .,en,en,en
Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years .,en,en,en
The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders .,en,en,en
Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party .,en,en,en
Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary .,en,en,en
These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city .,en,en,en
Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor .,en,en,en
In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate  Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley  the Bronx Democratic leader  and with Joseph T. Sharkey  the Brooklyn Democratic leader .,en,en,en
Mayor visits Buckley,en,en,en
As usual  he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio  the Manhattan leader .,en,en,en
He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party .,en,en,en
Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation .,en,en,en
Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle .,en,en,en
In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington  the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa  who lives in the Bronx  from this year's ticket .,en,en,en
But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor .,en,en,en
Screvane and Beame hailed,en,en,en
The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane  who lives in Queens  to replace Abe Stark  the incumbent  as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame  who lives in Brooklyn  to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller .,en,en,en
The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx .,en,en,en
After his speech  reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions  published in yesterday's New York Times .,en,en,en
The Mayor said :,en,en,en
`` It didn't come from me .,en,en,en
But as I have said before  if I announce my candidacy  I will have something definite to say about running mates '' .,en,en,en
Boston  June 16,en,en,en
-- A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts .,en,en,en
There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics .,en,en,en
The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same '' .,en,en,en
`` It's ' See Joe  see Jim ' ''  he says .,en,en,en
`` The hand is out '' .,en,en,en
A political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters ''  who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt  selfish and beyond popular control .,en,en,en
These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy  the object of which is to plunder them '' .,en,en,en
Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel  `` The Last Hurrah '' .,en,en,en
But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject .,en,en,en
A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year .,en,en,en
Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations .,en,en,en
And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state .,en,en,en
A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery  or worse  is the norm in Massachusetts public life .,en,en,en
Day after day some new episode is reported .,en,en,en
The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property .,en,en,en
An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate .,en,en,en
Washington  June 18,en,en,en
-- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers .,en,en,en
In the Senate  several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition .,en,en,en
In the House  the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill  while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill .,en,en,en
The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee .,en,en,en
It is expected to be reported out Tuesday  but this is a little uncertain .,en,en,en
The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble  Democrat of Arkansas  who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor .,en,en,en
Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday .,en,en,en
Leadership is hopeful,en,en,en
The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans .,en,en,en
The Democratic leadership  however  hopes to pass it sometime this week .,en,en,en
The $6100000000 measure  which was passed last Monday by the Senate  provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families .,en,en,en
It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories .,en,en,en
The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee  where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy .,en,en,en
They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts .,en,en,en
Three groups to meet,en,en,en
What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958 .,en,en,en
This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science  languages and mathematics .,en,en,en
Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee .,en,en,en
About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups  according to an official of the corps .,en,en,en
In the $40000000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval  $26000000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies .,en,en,en
Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage  Gordon Boyce  director of relations with the voluntary agencies  said in a Washington interview .,en,en,en
Six of these were proposed by religious groups .,en,en,en
They will be for teaching  agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia  Africa  the Middle East and Latin America .,en,en,en
Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods  means and goals .,en,en,en
There are a number of ways this could happen  the churchmen pointed out  and here is an example :,en,en,en
Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled .,en,en,en
When he protested  the hotel owner said :,en,en,en
`` Why do you worry ? ?,en,en,en
The U. S. Government is paying for it .,en,en,en
The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers '' .,en,en,en
`` I don't work for the Government ''  the American said .,en,en,en
`` I'm a missionary '' .,en,en,en
The hotel owner shrugged .,en,np2,en
`` Same thing ''  he said .,en,en,en
And then  some churchmen remarked  there is a more classical church-state problem :,en,en,en
Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ?,en,en,en
R. Sargent Shriver Jr.  director of the corps  is certain that they can .,en,en,en
No religious group  he declared in an interview  will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes .,en,en,en
Moscow  June 18,en,en,en
-- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia  Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said  beaming : `` Look  he took everything I had '' ! !,en,en,en
Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker .,en,en,en
Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid .,en,en,en
The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic  technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations .,en,en,en
The Communist countries allocated more than $1000000000 in economic aid alone last year  according to Western estimates .,en,en,en
This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 .,en,en,en
In 1960 more than 6000 Communist technicians were present in those countries .,en,en,en
United Nations  N. Y.  June 18,en,en,en
-- A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations .,en,en,en
This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations .,en,en,en
One effect of the proposal  which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength  as in the past  would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India .,en,en,en
India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400000000 inhabitants .,en,en,en
The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report .,en,en,en
The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations .,en,en,en
Formula is due this week,en,en,en
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week .,en,en,en
The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines :,en,en,en
Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts  such as political affairs officer  a department head or an economist  to start .,en,en,en
Each member would get one post for each 10000000 people in its population up to 150000000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts .,en,en,en
Each member with a population above 150000000 would get one additional post for each additional 30000000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point .,en,en,en
Geneva  June 18,en,en,en
-- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom .,en,en,en
The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum  Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; ;,en,en,en
Prince Souvanna Phouma  leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc  and Prince Souphanouvong  head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces .,en,en,en
The latter two are half-brothers .,en,en,en
Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos .,en,en,en
An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task  diplomats conceded .,en,en,en
But no one was overly optimistic .,en,en,en
Tactics studied in Geneva,en,en,en
W. Averell Harriman of the United States  Malcolm MacDonald of Britain  Maurice Couve De Murville  France's Foreign Minister  and Howard C. Green  Canada's Minister of External Affairs  concluded  meanwhile  a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference .,en,en,en
The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week .,en,en,en
Princess Moune  Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter  read the Princes' statement .,en,en,en
They had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation ''  she said .,en,en,en
The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks  which are to last three days .,en,en,en
The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days .,en,en,en
To deal with principles,en,en,en
The meetings in Zurich  the statement said  would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government .,en,en,en
Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr.  41  as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims  president of the company .,en,en,en
Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke  who resigned .,en,en,en
The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January  1946  as a commercial artist in the advertising department .,en,en,en
He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school  Fortier High school and Soule business college .,en,en,en
From June  1942  until December  1945  Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps .,en,en,en
While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville  Ill. .,en,en,en
Before entering the service  Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans .,en,en,en

-- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 .,en,en,en
Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day  hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route .,en,en,en
Pennsylvania Avenue  named for one of the original 13 states  perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint .,en,en,en
But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it .,en,en,en
Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings  plus shrines and monuments .,en,en,en
Of course  1600 Pennsylvania  the White House  is the most famous address of the free world .,en,en,en
Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue  begins a series of great federal buildings  some a block long and all about seven-stories high .,en,en,en
Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue  now about 169 years old .,en,en,en
In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade .,en,en,en
They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote .,en,en,en
In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time .,en,en,en
Seats on square,en,en,en
Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept .,en,en,en
Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation .,en,en,en
Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania  powered with lines that are underground .,en,en,en
Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square  opposite the White House .,en,en,en
In this historic square are several statues  but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson  hero of the Battle of New Orleans .,en,en,en
Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units .,en,en,en
About 16000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade .,en,en,en
Division one of the parade will be the service academies .,en,en,en
Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas  the respective states of the President and of Vice-President L. B. Johnson .,en,en,en
Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union .,en,en,en
Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states ; ;,en,en,en
division four will be headed by the Navy  followed by 11 states ; ;,en,en,en
division five  by the Air Force followed by 11 states .,en,en,en
Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard  followed by the reserve forces of all services  five states  Puerto Rico  the Virgin Islands  Guam  American Samoa  the trust territories and the Canal Zone .,en,en,en

-- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ? ?,en,en,en
Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time  no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future .,en,en,en
This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross Barnett .,en,en,en
Barnett  who came into office with no previous experience in public administration  has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well .,en,en,en
Consequently  it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year .,en,en,en
Could be scramble,en,en,en
Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far .,en,en,en
The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office .,en,en,en
There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session  it will really throw his administration into a scramble .,en,en,en
Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he had in the 1960 legislative session .,en,en,en
If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961  it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session .,en,en,en
The odds favor a special session  more than likely early in the year .,en,en,en
Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating .,en,en,en
Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure .,en,en,en
The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat .,en,en,en
With eyes focused on the third congressional district  the historic Delta district  and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go  the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature .,en,en,en
Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961  with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House .,en,en,en
Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents  the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck .,en,en,en
And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together .,en,en,en
Barnett  as the titular head of the Democratic party  apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary .,en,en,en
With a Democratic administration  party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election .,en,en,en
Now  the picture is clouded  and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis  who remained loyal to the ticket  are uncertain of their status .,en,en,en
Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen .,en,en,en
Baton Rouge  La.,en,en,en
-- The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961  with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses .,en,en,en
The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue .,en,en,en
But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government .,en,en,en
The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress  in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent .,en,en,en
The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy  since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program .,en,en,en
But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation .,en,en,en
Indeed  the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat .,en,en,en
The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program .,en,en,en
The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote .,en,en,en
The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes .,en,en,en
Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy .,en,en,en
If it fails to pass  he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration .,en,en,en
He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature .,en,en,en
Actually  Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway .,en,en,en
Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration .,en,en,en
This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly .,en,en,en
They would like to convey the notion something is being done  even though it is something they know to be ineffectual .,en,en,en
Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition .,en,en,en
He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle .,en,en,en
Then he could tell them to go home  while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period .,en,en,en
It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million  since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one .,en,en,en
But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program  a not unlikely conclusion  it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes .,en,en,en
This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash .,en,en,en
It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year .,en,en,en
If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill  or any other tax bill  it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma .,en,en,en
Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session  the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues .,en,en,en
In either case  it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser .,en,en,en
The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor .,en,en,en
It is one that most try to avoid  as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem .,en,en,en
But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off  it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature .,en,en,en
This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature  so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year .,en,en,en
A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize .,en,en,en
Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves .,en,en,en
The new year might see some house-cleaning  either genuine or token  depending upon developments  to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms .,en,en,en
City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city .,en,en,en
Estimates of the city's loss in the $344000 job have ranged as high as $200000 .,en,en,en
Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors .,en,en,en
The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway  Hemphill said .,en,en,en
The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday :,en,en,en
The city has sued for the full amount of the $172400 performance bond covering the contract .,en,en,en
The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project .,en,en,en
The signature of Harold V. Varani  former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property  appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project .,en,en,en
Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor .,en,en,en
Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter .,en,en,en
The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 .,en,en,en
The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries  Inc.  both of 3646 N. 2d St.  filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law .,en,en,en
On Monday  the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization .,en,en,en
Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish  Jr. .,en,en,en
Intervenes in case,en,en,en
The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms .,en,en,en
Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co. .,en,en,en
At Berger's direction  the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there .,en,en,en
`` I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated ''  Berger said .,en,en,en
The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track .,en,en,en
The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints .,en,en,en
The city paid for work on 75  of which no more than 21 were repaired  Hemphill charged .,en,en,en
Wide range in bids,en,en,en
Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint .,en,en,en
The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge  Mass.  which listed the same officers as Hughes  was $600 per joint .,en,en,en
But  Hemphill added  bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint .,en,en,en
Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference .,en,en,en
Wagner said the city paid only $37500 to the Hughes company .,en,en,en
`` We won't know the full amount until we get a full report ''  Wagner said .,en,en,en
`` We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond ''  Berger said .,en,en,en
Wagner replied  `` Can't you just see the headline : ' City Hooked for $172000 ' '' ? ?,en,en,en
' know enough to sue ',en,en,en
Berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount '' .,en,en,en
Douglas M. Pratt  president of the PTC  who attended the meeting  said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El .,en,en,en
`` We want to find out who knew about it ''  Pratt said .,en,en,en
`` Certain people must have known about it '' .,en,en,en
`` The PTC is investigating the whole matter ''  Pratt said .,en,en,en
Samuel D. Goodis  representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association  objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees  saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year .,en,en,en
Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee .,en,en,en
For hotels with 1000 rooms  the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year  Goodis said .,en,en,en
Testifies at hearing,en,en,en
His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses  permits and city services .,en,en,en
The new fees are expected to raise an additional $740000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2330000 more a year after that .,en,en,en
The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses  hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room .,np,en,en
The cost of a license now is $2  with an annual renewal fee of $1 .,en,en,en
Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels .,en,en,en
The city expects the higher rooming house  hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457000 a year .,en,en,en
The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan  spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia  on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses .,en,en,en
A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer  who formerly raised pedigreed dogs .,en,en,en
The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog .,en,en,en
Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care .,en,en,en
In reply  Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than $115000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43000 in fees .,en,en,en
He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67000 to the Women's S.P.C.A. ; ;,en,en,en
$15000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15000 to investigate dog bites .,en,en,en
Backs higher fees,en,np2,en
City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed the higher fees  which  he said  had been under study for more than a year .,en,en,en
The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees  he said .,en,en,en
The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis .,en,en,en

The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower  Davenport said .,en,en,en
Barnard  who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges  was fined $500 by Judge Warren K. Hess  and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time .,en,en,en

The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project .,en,en,en
One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12192865 .,np,en,en
The tract is bounded by Island Ave.  Dicks Ave.  61st St.  and Eastwick Ave. .,en,en,en
Four parks planned,en,np2,en
It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses  garden apartments  four small parks  schools  churches  a shopping center and several small clusters of stores .,np,en,en

The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp.  a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders  which is interested in developing part of the project .,en,en,en
Would bar vehicles,en,np2,en
The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis  former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp. .,en,en,en
The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic .,np,en,en
It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project .,en,en,en
The esplanade eliminates Grovers Ave.  which on original plans ran through the center of the development .,en,en,en
The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project .,en,en,en
Kansas City  Mo.  Feb. 9 ( UPI ),en,en,en
-- The president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work .,en,en,en
Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden  42  the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union  suffered multiple fractures of both ankles .,en,en,en
He was in Baptist Memorial hospital .,en,en,en
Ignition sets off blast,en,en,en
The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work .,en,en,en
`` I'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway ''  he said .,en,en,en
Gladden's wife and two of his sons  John  17  and Jim  13  were inside the house .,en,en,en
The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall .,en,en,en
Hood flies over house,en,en,en
The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house .,en,en,en
The left front wheel landed 100 feet away .,en,en,en
Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device  containing either TNT or nitroglycerine  was apparently placed under the left front wheel .,en,en,en
It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter .,en,en,en
Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night .,np,en,en
The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union .,en,en,en
Led fight on teamsters,en,en,en
Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters  which began organizing city firemen in 1959 .,en,en,en
The fire fighters association here offered a $5000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing .,en,en,en

Ankara  Turkey  Oct. 24 ( AP ),en,en,en
-- Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president .,en,en,en
An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat .,en,en,en
By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago  the army general staff  led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay  had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government .,en,en,en
The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president .,en,en,en
Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months .,en,en,en
The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned .,en,en,en
Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own .,en,en,en

Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically  E. M. Martin  assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night .,en,en,en
Martin  who has been in office in Washington  D. C.  for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel .,en,en,en
He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways  following their own paths .,en,en,en
`` We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which  if not identical  is congenial with ours ''  he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty .,en,en,en
Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice  he said  was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union .,en,en,en
He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in  and added  `` so long as people rebel  we must not give up '' .,en,en,en
Martin called for patience on the part of Americans .,en,en,en
`` The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build ''  he said .,en,en,en
By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare  he said .,en,en,en
Individual help best,en,en,en
`` We have no reason to fear failure  but we must be extraordinarily patient ''  the assistant secretary said .,en,en,en
Economically  Martin said  the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves .,en,en,en
Private business is more effective than government aid  he explained  because individuals are able to work with the people themselves .,en,en,en
The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country  at what he termed a `` social cost '' .,en,en,en
Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country .,en,en,en
The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack .,en,en,en
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go  and whose advice it should follow .,en,en,en
The board members  after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar  1409 SW Maplecrest Dr.  said they thought they had already been cooperating .,en,en,en
Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem  in case of atomic attack  but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go .,en,en,en
Dr. Melvin W. Barnes  superintendent  said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership  perhaps on the national level  to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful ''  and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district .,en,en,en
`` Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster ''  he said .,en,en,en
`` Nobody really expects to evacuate .,en,en,en
I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following .,en,en,en
Mrs. Molvar  who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand ''  said  `` We must have faith in somebody -- on the local level  and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children '' .,en,en,en
Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans  even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work '' .,en,en,en
Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program .,en,en,en
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting .,en,en,en
It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done  is going to be done and what it thought should be done .,en,en,en

A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God  in session at the Memorial Coliseum .,en,en,en
The council revised  in an effort to strengthen  the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 .,en,en,en
The changes  unanimously adopted  were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible .,en,en,en
The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible .,en,en,en
At the adoption  the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman  general superintendent  commented  `` The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has  without compromise  stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives '' .,np,en,en
New point added,en,en,en
Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; ;,en,en,en
however  the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list .,en,en,en
The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination  now reads :,en,en,en
`` The scriptures  both Old and New Testament  are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man  the infallible  authoritative rule of faith and conduct '' .,en,en,en
The third belief  in six points  emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ  and :,en,en,en
-- emphasizes the Virgin birth,en,en,en
-- the sinless life of Christ,en,en,en
-- His miracles,en,en,en
-- His substitutionary work on the cross,en,en,en
-- His bodily resurrection from the dead,en,en,en
-- and His exaltation to the right hand of God .,en,en,en
Super again elected,en,en,en
Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God .,en,en,en
His offices are in Springfield  Mo. .,en,en,en
Election came on the nominating ballot .,en,en,en
Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program  `` Breakthrough '' scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years .,en,en,en
In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman  urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program  with `` Breakthrough '' the theme for the first two years .,en,en,en
The Rev. R. L. Brandt  national secretary of the home missions department  stressed the need for the first two years' work .,en,en,en
`` Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church .,en,en,en
This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life ''  he told delegates Friday .,en,en,en
Church loses pace,en,en,en
Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes  he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge '' .,en,en,en
`` In 35 years we have opened 7000 churches ''  the Rev. Mr. Brandt said  adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10000 persons .,en,en,en
`` In this light we need 1000 churches in Illinois  where we have 200 ; ;,en,en,en
800 in Southern New England  we have 60 ; ;,en,en,en
we need 100 in Rhode Island  we have none ''  he said .,en,en,en
To step up the denomination's program  the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years .,en,en,en
To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods  he said .,en,en,en
' church meets change ',en,en,en
`` The church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour '' .,en,en,en
A capsule view of proposed plans includes :,en,en,en
-- Encouraging by every means  all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches .,en,en,en
-- Engaging mature  experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers .,en,en,en
-- Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen  who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ) .,en,en,en
-- Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches .,en,en,en
U.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial .,en,en,en
Denials were of motions of dismissal  continuance  mistrial  separate trial  acquittal  striking of testimony and directed verdict .,en,en,en
In denying motions for dismissal  Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are '' .,en,en,en
Attorney Dwight L. Schwab  in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein  argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy  but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide .,en,en,en
Proof lack charged,en,np2,en
Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud  to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied :,en,en,en
`` It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy  and the mails were then used to carry it out '' .,en,en,en
In the afternoon  defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements  some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case .,en,en,en
Miami  Fla.  March 17,en,en,en
-- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision  this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 .,np,en,en
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage .,en,en,en
Siebern hits homer,en,np,en
Over the first five frames  Jack Fisher  the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant  held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits .,en,en,en
Then Dick Hyde  submarine-ball hurler  entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock .,en,en,en
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game  and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts .,en,en,en
House throws wild,en,np2,en
With one down in the eighth  Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle .,en,en,en
Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt .,en,en,en
Then Heywood Sullivan  Kansas City catcher  singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run .,en,en,en
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser  a wild pitch  and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center .,en,en,en
The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion  gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers .,en,en,en
Three were doubles  Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one .,en,en,en
Bill Kunkel  Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium .,en,en,en
The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth .,en,en,en
Hartman  purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall  allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance  and merited the triumph .,en,en,en
Keegan  a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder  gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames  escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally .,en,en,en
Robinson doubles again,en,en,en

-- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training .,en,en,en
Hansen  who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a,en,en,en

The big  22-year-old shortstop  the 1960 American league `` rookie-of-the-year ''  flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore  signed his contract for an estimated $15000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row .,en,en,en
15 pounds lighter,en,en,en
The 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds  15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring .,en,en,en
He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence .,en,en,en
When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox  Ky.  Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said .,en,en,en
`` I feel good physically ''  Hansen added  `` but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now '' .,en,en,en

-- George Kerr  the swift-striding Jamaican  set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight  beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 .,en,en,en
Kerr  who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3  wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards .,en,en,en
Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield .,en,en,en
Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race .,en,en,en
Then Kerr  a graduate student from Illinois  moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn .,en,en,en
Mills was timed in 1.10.4 .,en,en,en

-- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays  Eldon Moritz  ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games .,en,en,en
Time stands still every time Moritz  a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran  goes into the field .,en,en,en
Although he never gets to play while the clock is running  he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday  in fact -- out of football .,en,en,en
Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl .,en,en,en
That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries .,en,en,en
He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State .,en,en,en
Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback  the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team .,en,en,en
But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response  `` place-kicker '' .,en,en,en
A 208-pound  6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford  Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking .,en,en,en
Last year  when he worked out at halfback all season  he didn't get into a single game .,en,en,en
`` This year  coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me ''  said Moritz .,en,en,en
`` So I started practicing on it in spring training .,en,en,en
Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and  as a result  several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough .,np,en,en
Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and  as a result  he hopes to start practicing field goals this week .,en,en,en
He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School  including one that beat Anson  3-0  in a 1953 district game .,en,en,en
`` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school ''  he said  `` and made 26 in a row at one time .,en,en,en
I never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years '' .,en,en,en
Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury .,en,en,en
He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee  then played 77 minutes in 1956 .,en,en,en
His statistical record that year  when Texas won only one game and lost nine  was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards  punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards .,en,en,en
He went into the Army in March  1957  and returned two years later .,en,en,en
But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season .,en,en,en
Place kicking is largely a matter of timing  Moritz declared .,en,en,en
`` Once you get the feel of it  there's not much to it .,en,en,en
I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel .,en,en,en
Practice helps you to get your timing down .,en,en,en
`` It's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often  your timing gets off '' .,en,en,en
Moritz  however  kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session .,en,en,en
`` If you kick too much  your leg gets kinda dead ''  he explained .,np,en,en
In their first three games  the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times  or 40 per cent ; ;,en,en,en
their total passing yardage in three games  447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts  is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959  when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries .,en,en,en
Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season  when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; ;,en,en,en
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games .,en,en,en
Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game  for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards  gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench .,en,en,en
Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma .,en,en,en
Last week  when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing  he said : `` That won't last long '' .,en,en,en
It didn't ; ;,en,en,en
Monday  he had four Longhorns in the top four .,en,en,en
A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday  but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University .,en,en,en
The Mustangs don't play this week .,en,en,en
`` We're just real happy for the players ''  Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy .,en,en,en
`` I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on .,en,en,en
It was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) '' .,en,en,en
Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling  I think  on the part of the coaches and the players .,en,en,en
We needed it and we got it '' .,en,en,en
Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon .,en,en,en
Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game .,en,en,en
`` Nelson played magnificent football ''  Meek praised .,en,en,en
`` He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times .,en,en,en
And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown .,en,en,en
He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' .,en,en,en
Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages .,en,en,en
One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory .,en,en,en
`` As soon as it started to form  Gannon spotted it ''  Meek said .,en,en,en
`` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around .,en,en,en
He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss '' .,en,en,en
The Air Force's  and the game's  final play  was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards .,en,en,en
`` He just lay back there and waited for it ''  Meek said .,en,en,en
`` He almost brought it back all the way '' .,en,en,en
Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice  Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice .,en,en,en
`` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game ''  Meek said .,en,en,en
`` He'll be out of action all this week .,en,en,en
He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game .,en,en,en
There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' .,en,en,en
Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland .,en,en,en
`` He's looking a lot better  and he's able to run ''  Meek explained .,en,en,en
`` We'll let him do a lot of running this week  but I don't know if he'll be able to play '' .,en,en,en
The game players saw the Air Force film Monday  ran for 30 minutes  then went in  while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes .,en,en,en
`` We'll work hard Tuesday  Wednesday and Thursday ''  Meek said  `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday .,en,en,en
We'll work out about an hour on Saturday  then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week  then taper off '' .,en,en,en

The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos -- but their visit will be a short one .,en,en,en
The Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again  and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings .,en,en,en
Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey  who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks  apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers  M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb .,en,en,en
Rabb  the former Louisiana State field general  came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers  defending league champions .,en,en,en
`` Just our luck '' ! !,en,en,en
Exclaimed Stram .,en,en,en
`` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way '' .,en,en,en
Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself  for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver  and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star  Jack Spikes  though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury .,en,en,en
`` Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well ''  said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game .,en,en,en
`` In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' .,en,en,en
The Texans won the game through ball control  with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes .,en,en,en
`` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack ''  explained Stram .,en,en,en
`` They can be going along  doing little damage  then bang  bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble '' .,en,en,en
The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans  but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off .,en,en,en
The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes  the flashy halfback .,en,en,en
He was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards .,en,en,en
The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson  the speedy halfback  hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas .,en,en,en
A quick touchdown resulted .,en,en,en
`` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away ''  said Stram  quipping  `` I think I'll put that play in the book '' .,en,en,en
The early Southwest Conference football leaders -- Texas  Arkansas and Texas A & M -- made a big dent in the statistics last week .,en,en,en
Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1512 yards ( 1065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high .,en,en,en
Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU  and A & M  with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 .,en,en,en
Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards  the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards .,en,en,en
Texas leads in per-game rushing averages  355 yards  and passing 149 ( to Baylor's 126 )  but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189 ) .,en,en,en
A & M has the best defense against passes  34.7 yards per game .,en,en,en

The husky 6-3  205-pound lefthander  was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area .,en,en,en
It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight .,en,en,en
They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack .,en,en,en
Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning .,en,en,en
He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings  an unusual characteristic for a southpaw .,en,en,en
The Bears took the lead in the first inning  as they did in Sunday's opener  and never lagged .,en,en,en

The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert .,en,en,en
Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth .,en,en,en
Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48  thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play .,en,en,en
Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base .,en,en,en
Bingles and bobbles :,en,en,en
Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits .,en,en,en

And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday .,en,en,en
Both  of course  were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime .,en,en,en
Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts .,en,en,en
It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone .,en,en,en
And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked  `` Wish I was 40  and a top-grade big leaguer .,en,en,en
The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days .,en,en,en
But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history .,en,en,en
Yes  with Bob Grove  Carl Hubbell  Herb Pennock  Art Nehf  Vernon Gomez  et al .,en,en,en
Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow  a ball player's ball player  as they say in the trade .,en,en,en
I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14  1951  before a new record crowd for the period of 18792 .,en,en,en
`` Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions ''  remarked Enos Slaughter  another all-out guy  who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse .,np,en,en
The spectacular Mays  who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25  joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings .,en,en,en
Incidentally  only two did it before a home audience .,en,en,en
Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field .,en,en,en
Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies  the Braves' Joe Adcock  Lou Gehrig of the Yankees  Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito  then with Cleveland  made their history on the road .,en,en,en
Willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle .,en,en,en
This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion  depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee .,en,en,en
The record books  however  would favor the Giants' ace .,en,en,en
In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases .,en,en,en
Once the figure was 30-30 .,en,en,en
Willie's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond Mickey's .,en,en,en
The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park .,en,en,en
It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump .,en,en,en
The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs  thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home .,en,en,en
This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers .,en,en,en
The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the `` Living Room Athletic Club '' when games were cut off .,en,en,en
Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy .,en,en,en
This year  I am told  the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here .,en,en,en
There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise .,en,en,en
It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good  especially at the minor league level .,en,en,en
You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy .,en,en,en
This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game .,en,en,en
Cincinnati  Ohio ( AP ),en,en,en
-- The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati  crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale .,en,en,en
With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries  the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers  the most ever used by one team in a series game .,en,en,en
Johnny Blanchard  Mantle's replacement  slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning .,en,en,en
Hector Lopez  subbing for Berra  smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth .,en,en,en
The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors .,en,en,en
The crowd of 32589 had only two chances to applaud .,en,en,en
In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center  about 400 feet away  with two men on .,en,en,en
Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game  trailing only 6-3  but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out .,en,en,en
In the fifth  Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley  but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter .,en,en,en
The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager .,en,en,en
Only Bucky Harris  the `` boy-manager '' of Washington in 1924  and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat .,en,en,en
Philadelphia  Jan. 23,en,en,en
-- Nick Skorich  the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles  was elevated today to head coach .,en,en,en
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20000 and $25000 a year .,en,en,en
He succeeds Buck Shaw  who retired at the end of last season .,en,en,en
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer .,en,en,en
Williams is a defensive coach .,en,en,en
Gauer works with the ends .,en,en,en
Choice was expected,en,en,en
The selection had been expected .,en,en,en
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings  the newest National Football League entry .,en,en,en
Van Brocklin  the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title  was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday .,en,en,en
Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player .,en,en,en
With Skorich at the helm  the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running  rather than passing .,en,en,en
In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials .,en,en,en
Skorich  however  is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing .,en,en,en
Coach played 3 years,en,en,en
Skorich  who is 39 years old  played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers .,en,en,en
An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season .,en,en,en
He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 .,en,en,en
He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy  N. Y. .,en,en,en
He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach .,en,en,en
Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers .,en,en,en
The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959 .,en,en,en
Skorich began his new job auspiciously today .,en,en,en
At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth  the Eagles were honored for winning the championship .,en,en,en
Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players  coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football .,np,en,en
With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William A. ( ( Bill ) Shea  the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter  Baseball Writers' Association of America  at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel .,en,en,en
Shea  the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee  will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn  the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; ;,en,en,en
Frank Graham  the Journal-American sports columnist ; ;,en,en,en
Bill Mazeroski  the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates  and Casey Stengel  the former manager of the Yankees .,en,en,en
Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award .,np,en,en
Mazeroski  whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game  will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series .,en,en,en
Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award .,en,en,en
To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year .,en,en,en
Show follows ceremonies,en,np2,en
A crowd of 1400 is expected for the ceremonies  which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit  dance and song .,en,en,en
The 53-year-old Shea  a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background  is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York .,en,en,en
Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley  Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume  Shea worked relentlessly .,en,en,en
His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city .,en,en,en
The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees .,en,en,en
Despite countless barriers and disappointments  Shea moved forward .,en,en,en
When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion  he sought to convince another National League club to move here .,en,en,en
When that failed  he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league  the Continental  with New York as the key franchise .,en,en,en
The Continental League never got off the ground  but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand .,en,en,en
Flushing stadium in works,en,en,en
The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson .,en,en,en
A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works  and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick .,en,en,en
Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium .,en,en,en
Shea and his wife  Nori  make their home at Sands Point  L. I. .,en,en,en
Bill Jr.  20  Kathy  15  and Patricia  9  round out the Shea family .,en,en,en
Shea was born in Manhattan .,en,en,en
He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington .,en,en,en
He played basketball there while working toward a law degree .,en,en,en
Later  Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians  a minor league professional football team .,en,en,en
He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League .,en,en,en
All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday .,en,en,en
On Friday  Roger Maris  the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award  will meet with Roy Hamey  the general manager .,en,en,en
Maris is in line for a big raise .,en,en,en
Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight .,en,en,en
The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre .,en,en,en
Palmer  golf's leading money-winner in 1960  and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin .,en,en,en
Deane Beman  the National Amateur champion  and all the metropolitan district champions  including Bob Gardner  the amateur title-holder  also will receive awards .,en,en,en
The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield  N. J.  and Palm Beach  Fla.  for his sponsorship of charity tournaments .,en,en,en
Horton Smith of Detroit  a former president of the Professional Golfers Association  will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness .,en,en,en
The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington  Democrat of Missouri .,en,en,en
Golf's golden boy,en,np,en
Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months .,en,en,en
He won the Masters  the United States Open and a record $80738 in prize money .,en,en,en
He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated  and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year ''  a distinction that earned for him the $10000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt .,en,en,en
But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot .,en,en,en
A couple of weeks ago  he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole .,en,en,en
It made him human .,en,en,en
And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair .,en,en,en
If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege  there was hope left for all .,en,en,en
It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold .,en,en,en
He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all .,en,en,en
The world's best golfer  shooting below par  came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher .,en,en,en
He boomed a 280-yard drive .,en,en,en
Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance .,en,en,en
No margin for error,en,en,en
On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole  Arnold whipped into his second shot .,en,en,en
The ball went off in a majestic arc  an out-of-bounds slice .,en,en,en
He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds .,en,en,en
He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side .,en,en,en
`` It is possible that I over-corrected ''  he said ruefully .,en,en,en
Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes .,en,en,en
So he wound up with a dozen .,en,en,en
`` It was a nice round figure  that 12 ''  he said as he headed for the clubhouse  not too much perturbed .,en,en,en
From the standpoint of the army of duffers  however  this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open .,en,en,en
The idol of the hackers  of course  is Ray Ainsley  who achieved a 19 in the United States Open .,en,en,en
Their secondary hero is another pro  Willie Chisholm  who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully .,en,en,en
Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes  who tried to keep count .,en,en,en
Stickler for rules,en,en,en
`` How many is that  Jim '' ? ?,en,en,en
Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project .,en,en,en
`` Thirteen ''  said Long Jim .,en,en,en
`` Nae  man ''  said Willie  `` ye must be countin' the echoes '' .,en,en,en
He had a 16 .,en,en,en
Palmer's dozen were honestly earned .,en,en,en
Nor were there any rules to save him .,en,en,en
If there had been  he would have found a loophole  because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book .,en,en,en
This knowledge has come in handy  too .,en,en,en
His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway .,en,en,en
The ball floated downstream .,en,en,en
A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy  who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie .,en,en,en
Arnold sent for Joe Dey  the executive secretary of the golf association .,en,en,en
Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream .,en,en,en
`` I knew it all along ''  confessed Arnold with a grin  `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' .,en,en,en
For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity  Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings .,en,en,en
Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors .,en,en,en
He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right .,en,en,en
That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 .,en,en,en
It happened on the twelfth hole  a 155-yarder .,en,en,en
Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green  an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains  thereby bringing local rules into force .,en,en,en
Ruling from on high,en,en,en
`` I can remove the ball  can't I '' ? ?,en,en,en
Asked Palmer of an official .,en,en,en
`` No ''  said the official .,en,en,en
`` You must play it where it lies '' .,en,en,en
`` You're wrong ''  said Arnold  a man who knows the rules .,en,en,en
`` I'll do as you say  but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' .,en,en,en
He scored a 4 for the embedded ball  a 3 with the provisional one .,en,en,en
The golfing fathers ruled in his favor .,en,en,en
So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke .,en,en,en
Until a few weeks ago  however  Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers .,en,en,en
But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys  a bigger hero than he ever had been before .,en,en,en
A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today .,en,en,en
Other items on the agenda during the meetings  which are expected to continue through Saturday  concern television  rules changes  professional football's hall of fame  players' benefits and constitutional amendments .,en,en,en
The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division  plus two games against teams in the other division .,en,en,en
However  this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks .,en,en,en
Pete Rozelle  the league commissioner  pointed out :,en,en,en
`` We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' .,en,en,en
Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates .,en,en,en
If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies  they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season .,en,en,en
`` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat ''  Mauch said here the other day .,en,en,en
`` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year .,en,en,en
They have the same men  no age problem  no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season  along with Bobby Shantz '' .,en,en,en
Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals  who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960  breaking even with them  will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions .,en,en,en
The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 .,en,en,en
Change in pitchers .,en,en,en
Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher  from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio  for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ;,en,en,en
2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ;,en,en,en
3 The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday .,en,en,en
Manager Hemus  eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand  moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment .,en,en,en
After Thursday's open date  Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night .,en,en,en
Harvey Haddix  set back by the flu this season  will start against his former Cardinal mates  who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium .,en,en,en
Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck .,en,en,en
Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds  despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 .,en,en,en
Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game .,en,en,en
Mizell has won both of his starts .,en,en,en
Nieman kept in lineup .,en,en,en
After a lengthy workout yesterday  an open date  Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup .,en,en,en
That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants .,en,en,en
`` I have to stay with Nieman for a while ''  Hemus said .,en,en,en
`` Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready .,en,en,en
With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh  I may use Don Taussig in center '' .,en,en,en
`` Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes  and he looked good ''  Hemus said .,en,en,en
`` He should be getting back in the groove before long .,en,en,en
Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' .,en,en,en
The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice  but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday .,en,en,en
Six Bucks over .,en,en,en
Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend  the champions had eight men hitting over .,en,en,en
Despite the recession  Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess  Gino Cimoli  Bill Virdon  Bob Clemente and Dick Groat  each,en,en,en
 Dick Stuart  Don Hoak,en,en,en
and Bob Skinner,en,en,en
Bill Mazeroski with and Hal Smith with were the only Pirates dragging their feet .,en,en,en
Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend  who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs .,en,en,en
Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week .,en,en,en
`` We're getting Friend some runs for a change  and he has been pitching good ''  Murtaugh said .,en,en,en
`` Virdon has been blasting the ball .,en,en,en
No plunkers for him '' .,en,en,en
Six Bucs over .,en,en,en
The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year  when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season .,en,en,en
On last May 1  the Cardinals stood at 7-6  ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone .,en,en,en
In 1958  the Birds were 3-10 on May 1 .,en,en,en
A year later they were 4-13 .,en,en,en
Since 1949  the St. Louis club has been below on May 1 just four times .,en,en,en
The '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning  then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories .,en,en,en
The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs  the club's top since 1949 .,en,en,en
Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories .,en,en,en
Since 1949  the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team .,en,en,en
Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8 .,en,en,en
The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants  who dropped 11 of their first 13 .,en,en,en
They honored the battling Billikens last night .,en,en,en
Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who  in the words of Coach John Benington  `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' .,en,en,en
The most valuable player award was split three ways  among Glen Mankowski  Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer .,en,en,en
In addition  a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann  the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury .,en,en,en
`` You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing ''  Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies  `` but what this team had was a little different .,en,en,en
The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability .,en,en,en
They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do .,en,en,en
`` Several times I found the players pepping me up  where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk .,en,en,en
We'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say  ' Don't worry  Coach -- we'll get 'em all right ' '' .,en,en,en
The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg  sports editor of the Post-Dispatch .,np,en,en
Kieffer  the only junior in the group  was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch  as well as his all-round excellent play .,en,en,en
Mankowski  the ball-hawking defensive expert  was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.'s nationally televised victory .,en,en,en
Benington said  `` I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' .,en,en,en
Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills .,en,en,en
After the coach listed all the boy's faults  Hartweger said  `` Coach before I leave here  you'll get to like me '' .,en,en,en
Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team .,en,en,en
As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl  he said  `` I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play '' .,en,en,en
Bob Burnes  sports editor of the Globe-Democrat  presented Bob Nordmann with his award .,en,en,en
Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time .,en,en,en
Within a week after the injury  suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament  Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington .,en,en,en
On the clock given him was the inscription  `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball  1960-61 '' .,en,en,en
Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric  Donnell Reid  Bill Nordmann  Dave Harris  Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich .,en,en,en
`` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future ''  Benington pointed out .,en,en,en
`` By winning against Bradley  Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts  they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it '' .,en,en,en
St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game .,en,en,en
Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game  said to be the first in Billiken baseball history  as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College  5-1  at Crystal City .,en,en,en
The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie .,en,en,en
The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday .,en,en,en
Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double  Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple .,en,en,en
St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field .,en,en,en
The game opened a busy week for Washington .,en,en,en
The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy  Ill.  Saturday .,en,en,en
If it's true that contented cows give more milk  why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ? ?,en,en,en
The two top talents of the time  Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays  have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which  to be frank about it  never have quite reached expectations .,en,en,en
And that's meant as a boost  not a knock .,en,en,en
Mays and Mantle  both 10-year men at 30  have so much ability that  baseball men agree  they've never hit the heights .,en,en,en
Their heights  that is .,en,en,en
Mantle  the bull-necked blond switch-hitter  had one sensational triple-crown season  1959  when he batted and also led the American League in home runs  52  and rbi's  130 .,en,en,en
Like the Yankees' slugger  Mays  the terror of the Giants  has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players  but not by -- or for -- Willie .,en,en,en
His best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs  drove in 127 and stole 24 bases .,en,en,en
Now  apparently happier under new managers  Mays and Mantle  the perfect players  are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks .,en,en,en
Yes  we know  they're professionals  men paid to play  and they shouldn't care how they're handled  just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month .,en,en,en
The truth is  though  that men react differently to different treatment .,en,en,en
For that matter  Stan Musial is rare  possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers  reserving his opinions  but not his effort .,en,en,en
Mantle  it's apparent  resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility .,en,en,en
The old man was almost too possessive .,en,en,en
Stengel inherited DiMaggio  Rizzuto  but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors  from Joplin to New York .,en,en,en
With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him  Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter  but also the best bunter  base-runner and outfielder .,en,en,en
Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats .,en,en,en
Inheriting a more mature Mantle  who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway  Ralph Houk quietly bestowed  no pun intended  the mantle of authority on Mickey .,en,en,en
The Major decided that  rather than be led  the slugger could lead .,en,en,en
And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far .,en,en,en
The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule  pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr.  Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books  Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927 .,en,en,en

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St. .,en,en,en
The pert  gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo  N.Y.  is a `` civilian '' with the Army .,en,en,en
Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director .,en,en,en
The job also covers a number of other items .,en,en,en
`` Mom '' Marr  as the more than 80 men at the center call her  is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society .,np,en,en
Her day starts early  but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May  which is National Salvation Army Week  there are plenty )  schedules to be made or problems to be solved  Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out .,en,en,en
Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up .,en,en,en
She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures .,en,en,en
`` Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men ''  Mrs. Marr explained .,en,en,en
The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center .,en,en,en
`` And I bum tickets to everything I can ''  she said .,en,en,en
`` I've become the greatest beggar in the world '' .,en,en,en

My husband and I  a month ahead of the rush  have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson  Ariz.  to New York City :,en,en,en

I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene  such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent  far-flung over-night accommodations .,en,en,en
Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry  but it certainly looks that way from the highway .,en,en,en
There are motels for all purposes and all tastes .,en,en,en

There the Royal Motel advertises `` all facilities  vented heat  air conditioned  carpeted  free TV  storm cellar '' .,en,en,en
Many with pools,en,en,en
Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) .,en,en,en
Some even boast two pools  one for adults and one for children .,en,en,en
But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar .,en,en,en
Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2  can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business .,en,en,en
All for $14 ! !,en,en,en

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday .,en,en,en
The current monthly payroll comes to about $15000000 .,en,en,en
Howard E. Simpson  the railroad's president  said  `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' .,en,en,en
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates .,en,en,en
Salary cut and lay-offs,en,en,en
It will be accomplished in two ways : 1,en,en,en
A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers  supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions .,en,en,en
There are about 3325 officers and employees in this class .,en,en,en
Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense .,en,en,en
Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract  it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough  a B. & O. spokesman said .,en,en,en
Those union members kept on their jobs  therefore  will not take a cut in their wages .,en,en,en
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job .,en,en,en
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount Streets .,en,en,en

-- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what .,en,en,en
The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams  Jr.  a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent  argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting .,en,en,en
The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting .,en,en,en
Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval .,en,en,en
`` I hate to have these things come up again and again ''  Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion .,en,en,en
`` These are the board's minutes .,en,en,en
I'll write what you tell me to '' .,en,en,en
For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago .,en,en,en
It was about that time  a board member said later  that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen  Jr.  State superintendent of schools  told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him .,en,en,en
The Board of County Commissioners  the Sanitary Commission  the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings .,en,en,en
Dr. Jenkins notes  however  that most of the school boards in the State do not do so .,en,en,en
State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli ( D.  First Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt Street .,en,en,en

The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies '' in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible .,en,en,en
Councilman William D. Schaefer ( D.  Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month .,en,en,en
Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm  Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here .,en,en,en
He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December .,en,en,en
Equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall ''  Mr. Schaefer said .,en,en,en
The Councilman  who is the Administration floor leader  also criticized Bernard L. Werner  public works director  for `` halting snow operations '' on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm .,en,en,en
Sent home for rest,en,en,en
Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week .,en,en,en
What he did  Mr. Werner said  was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest .,en,en,en
Work resumed Wednesday  he said .,en,en,en
Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan  under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them  should be `` strictly enforced '' .,en,en,en
Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority  the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive '' .,en,en,en
Recounting personal observations of clearance work  the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes .,en,en,en

Each had been shot in the back several times with a,en,en,en
automatic rifle  according to Capt. Elmer Hagner  chief of Anne Arundel detectives .,en,en,en
Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail .,en,en,en
The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court .,en,en,en
Younger son calls police,np,np,en
Soon after 10 A.M.  when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section  15 miles south of here on the bay  in response to a call from the Dresbach's other son  Lee  14  they found Mrs. Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor .,en,en,en
Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor  police said .,en,en,en
The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car .,en,en,en
The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio .,en,en,en
Two brothers adopted,en,np2,en
Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs .,en,en,en

Maryland contracts for future construction during October totaled $77389000  up to 10 per cent compared to October  1960  F. W. Dodge  Dodge Corporation  reported .,en,en,en
Dodge reported the following breakdown :,en,en,en
Nonresidential at $20447000  down 28 per cent ; ;,en,en,en
residential at $47101000  up 100 per cent ; ;,en,en,en
and heavy engineering at $9841000  down 45 per cent .,en,en,en
The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634517000  a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year .,en,en,en
A breakdown of the ten-month total showed :,en,en,en
Nonresidential at $253355000  up 22 per cent ; ;,en,en,en
residential at $278877000  up 12 per cent ; ;,en,en,en
and heavy engineering at $102285000  down 33 per cent .,en,en,en
Residential building consists of houses  apartments  hotels  dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter .,en,en,en
The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments  which began about six years ago  has more than tripled within that span of time .,en,en,en
In 1961  it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction .,en,en,en
While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction  the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field .,en,en,en
Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments  Leo J. Pantas  vice president of a hardware manufacturing company  pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house .,en,en,en
Convenience held key,en,np2,en
`` Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today .,en,en,en
Trouble-free  long-life  quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 ''  Pantas predicted .,en,en,en
Sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section .,en,en,en
Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units  in two-story and three-story structures .,en,en,en
Various of the apartments are of the terrace type  being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct .,en,en,en
Others  which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs  have balconies .,en,en,en
The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction .,en,en,en
Heating is by individual gas-fired  forced warm air systems .,en,en,en
Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product  according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation .,en,en,en
London  Feb. 9,en,en,en
-- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine  the Dreadnought  and  by implication  of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet  were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring  secret service agents testified today .,en,en,en
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year .,en,en,en
It is a killer sub -- that is  a hunter of enemy subs .,en,en,en
It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus  the world's first atomic submarine .,en,en,en
Its power unit  however  was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack .,en,en,en
Five held for trial,en,en,en
The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing .,en,en,en
A full trial was ordered for :,en,en,en
Two British civil servants  Miss Ethel Gee  46  and her newly devoted friend  Harry Houghton  55  and divorced .,en,en,en
They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard .,en,en,en
Gordon A. Lonsdale  37  a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport .,en,en,en
When arrested  he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping  it was testified .,en,en,en
Flashed to Moscow,en,en,en
A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger  bookseller  and wife  Joyce .,en,en,en
( In Washington  the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen  an American couple formerly of New York City ),en,en,en
In their suburban cottage the crown charges  the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man  usually on the first Saturday evening of each month  and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow  either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books .,np,en,en
Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing  a printed page  or a manuscript .,en,en,en
All five pleaded innocent .,en,en,en
Only Miss Gee asked for bail .,en,en,en
Her young British lawyer  James Dunlop  pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother  80  her maiden aunt  also 80 and bedridden for 20 years  and her uncle  76  who once ran a candy shop .,en,en,en
Refuses to grant bail,en,en,en
`` I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them ''  said the magistrate  K.J.P. Baraclough .,en,en,en
The trial will be held  probably the first week of March  in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs  the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s  was sentenced to 14 years in prison .,en,en,en
Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five  who may have altered history in the 1960s .,en,en,en
Fuchs  after nine and a half years  was released  being given time off for good behavior .,en,en,en
He promptly went to communist East Germany .,en,en,en
The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29000 in American and British currency  mostly $20 bills  and in British government bonds and stocks .,en,en,en
`` This is Russian money ''  said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's office .,en,en,en
He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow  Lonsdale the Red paymaster  and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets .,en,en,en
`` Of highest value '',en,en,en
The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought  and thereby of the American undersea fleet  were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier .,en,en,en
But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare  Capt. George Symonds .,en,en,en
He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon  Jan. 7 .,np,en,en
The information  he said  would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy .,en,en,en
Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring  watched for six months  was broken remained untold .,en,en,en
The British defending lawyers  who today increased from three to four  demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury  the chances of their clients would improve .,en,en,en
So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour .,en,en,en
Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet .,en,en,en
Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed .,en,en,en
The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack .,en,en,en
With the machinery went a complete design for the hull .,en,en,en
The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub  much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it .,en,en,en
Navy's future involved,en,en,en
`` Much of the navy's future depends upon her ''  an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August  1959  for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station .,en,en,en
It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work .,en,en,en
`` Her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines  including the potent Polaris missile submarines ''  the statement went on .,en,en,en
The atom reactor  water cooled  was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp. .,en,en,en
Thru development  the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size  and also in complexity  allowing a single propeller to be used  the navy said .,en,en,en
The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work .,en,en,en
It was first tried out on a conventional submarine  the Albacore  in 1954 .,en,en,en
The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built .,en,en,en
Reputedly it could outrun  underwater  the fastest destroyers .,en,en,en

The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor  combined with malice  and individual enmity '' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court .,en,en,en
The three -- Miles J. Cooperman  Sheldon Teller  and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws .,en,en,en

They  on occasion  posed as addicts and peddlers '' .,en,en,en
Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together  Sokol continued  rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals '' .,en,en,en
This  he added  brought about `` petty jealousies '' and `` petty personal grievances '' .,en,en,en
`` In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy ''  Sokol continued  `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations  and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal '' .,en,en,en

-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach .,en,en,en
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion .,en,en,en
He returned to his cell in the county jail  where he has been held since his arrest last July  without a word to his court-appointed attorney  Jack Walker  or his guard .,en,en,en
The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson  Vincent Hengesbach  54  who was tried for the same crime in December  1958  and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict .,en,en,en
Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31  1958 .,en,en,en
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since .,en,en,en

`` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed .,en,en,en
Still  I don't wish to appear happy at somebody else's misfortune '' .,en,en,en
Lives on welfare,en,en,en
Hengesbach  who has been living on welfare recently  said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia  27 miles southwest of here .,en,en,en
Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 .,en,en,en
Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police .,en,en,en
He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach .,en,en,en
However  the confession  which was the only evidence against him  was retracted before the trial .,en,en,en
Charges in doubt,en,en,en
Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis  who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases  said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl .,en,en,en
Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing .,en,en,en
Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation .,en,en,en
Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure .,en,en,en
Locked in motel,en,en,en
A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation .,en,en,en
The jury  which was locked up in a motel overnight  was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced .,en,en,en
The jury foreman  Mrs. Olive Heideman  of rural Elsie  said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence .,en,en,en
She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession was valid .,en,en,en
The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter .,en,en,en
The verdict came three hours later .,en,en,en
Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read .,en,en,en

There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School  3505o Dequindre  which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine .,en,en,en

Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible .,en,en,en
`` Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race ''  board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated .,en,en,en
But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes .,en,en,en
The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law  tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated .,en,en,en
`` Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning  of true university grade  and meet its financial obligations  without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions ''  the statement said .,en,en,en
The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation .,en,en,en
An Emory spokesman indicated  however  that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws .,en,en,en
The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if  among other criteria  `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people  and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people '' .,en,en,en
At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies  but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state .,en,en,en
Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church .,en,en,en
Some church leaders  both clerical and lay  have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation .,en,en,en
Urged in 1954,en,en,en
The student newspaper  The Emory Wheel  as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation .,en,en,en
`` From its beginning ''  the trustees' statement said Friday  `` Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning .,en,en,en
Teaching  research and study  according to highest standards  under Christian influence  are paramount in the Emory University policy .,en,en,en
`` As a private institution  supported by generous individuals  Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education .,en,en,en
`` There is not now  nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race  color or creed .,en,en,en
Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned  Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students  and others seeking applications from prospective students  and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university  irrespective of race  color or creed .,en,en,en
`` On the other hand  Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia .,en,en,en
`` When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities  Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race  color or creed  continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education '' .,en,en,en

The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins '' if negotiations failed .,np,en,en
The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights .,en,en,en
' intend to attend ',en,en,en
`` We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year ''  the identically worded letters said .,en,en,en

Downtown and art theater managers and owners  contacted Friday night for comment on the COAHR request  said they had no knowledge of such a letter  and that it was not in the Friday mail .,np,en,en
However  three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend .,en,en,en
The COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday .,np,en,en
Several theater operators said  however  that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair .,np,en,en
Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago .,np,en,en
Charles A. Black  COAHR chairman  said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct. 31 but had failed to show up .,np,en,en
He declined to name the three .,en,en,en
Friday's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting .,en,en,en
Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend  the letters said  would be considered a `` sign of indifference '' .,en,en,en
Black said COAHR `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action  but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal '',en,en,en
A prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that `` extensive research by COAHR into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits '',np,en,en
Besides managers of downtown theaters  the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead .,en,en,en

-- For a second month in a row  Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need  the state public welfare commission was told Friday .,en,en,en
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category  for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary .,en,en,en
William Smythe  director of field service  told the commissioners that Multnomah  as of Aug. 22  had spent $58918 out of its budgeted $66000 in the category  leaving only $7082 for the rest of the month .,en,en,en
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month  this could mean a shortage of as high as $17000 .,en,en,en
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month  Smythe said .,en,en,en
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received  however .,en,en,en
Board oks pact,en,np2,en
The commission  meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners  Roy Webster  of Hood River  and Dr. Ennis Keizer  of North Bend  approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past .,en,en,en
The contract with Ray Field  who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape  would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month .,en,en,en
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes .,en,en,en
Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program  the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period .,en,en,en
But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles  and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' .,en,en,en
He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing  `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' .,en,en,en
Salary termed modest,en,np2,en
Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government .,en,en,en
He also said that the salary  in terms of going rates in the field  was `` modest '' in terms of the man's responsibility .,en,en,en
The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed  he said  and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program .,en,en,en
`` Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract '' ? ?,en,en,en
Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck  representative from Multnomah County  of the commission chairman  Joseph E. Harvey Jr. .,en,en,en
`` My feeling at the moment ''  he said  `` is that we have no alternative  irrespective of some of the arguments about him .,en,en,en
The continued operation of this program depends on having his service '' .,en,en,en
Mrs. Peck  later joined by the commission's vice-chairman  Mrs. Lee Patterson  took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday .,en,en,en
A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service  of which Harvey is president  quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem  instead of `` crippling '' the agency  had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses  with the key being improved communications between F & A and the commission staff .,en,en,en
`` I rather resent ''  she said  `` you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this .,en,en,en
I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people .,en,en,en
The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles '' .,en,en,en
Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare '' .,en,en,en

Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife  Carl W. Buchheister  president of the National Audubon Society  said today .,en,en,en
`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play ''  he commented .,np,en,en
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target  the fire ant .,en,en,en
`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop ''  he said .,en,en,en
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming .,en,en,en
There have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service  whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training  he added .,en,en,en
`` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who  forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents  are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries ''  Buchheister told the delegates .,en,en,en
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying  Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill  creation of national seashore parks  including Point Reyes ; ;,en,en,en

Seventeen years ago today  German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber .,en,en,en
The World War 2  German bomber rolled down a runway and took off .,en,en,en
The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip .,en,en,en
This had never been done before .,en,en,en
Now a quiet-spoken  middle-aged man  Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale  where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile .,en,en,en
He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 .,en,en,en
`` The first two pilots had crashed ''  he said .,en,en,en
`` I had developed the machines and therefore knew them .,en,en,en
It was time to go up myself '' .,en,en,en
Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret `` Reichenberg project ''  which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war .,en,en,en
About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead .,en,en,en
The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe .,en,en,en
The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight .,en,en,en
Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism  the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude .,en,en,en
At 12000 feet  Fiedler signaled `` release ''  and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel .,en,en,en
To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck  hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h. .,en,en,en
It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile .,en,en,en
`` She flew beautifully ''  said Fiedler .,en,en,en
`` There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow .,en,en,en
I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip '' .,en,en,en
Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons  Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage .,en,en,en
He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield .,en,en,en
Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip  edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed .,en,en,en
Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles .,en,en,en
The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb .,en,en,en
Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water  striking below the waterline of individual ships .,en,en,en
A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers  but the project was halted before the end of the war  and the missiles later fell into Allied hands .,en,en,en
Now a family man with three children  Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale .,en,en,en
His spare time is spent in soaring gliders .,en,en,en
`` It's so quiet ''  he said  `` so slow  serene -- and so challenging '' .,en,en,en

A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein  47  who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant '' and operator of a janitors' service .,en,en,en
Before he testified for 20 minutes  Stein  who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr.  admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums .,en,en,en
Glimco a buddy,en,en,en
Among his gangland buddies  he said  were Joseph ( Joey ) Glimco  a mob labor racketeer  and four gang gambling chiefs  Gus ( Slim ) Alex  Ralph Pierce  Joe ( Caesar ) DiVarco  and Jimmy ( Monk ) Allegretti .,en,en,en
Another hoodlum  Louis Arger  drew $39000 from Stein's janitor firm  the National Maintenance company  in three years ending in 1959  Stein disclosed in an interview .,en,en,en
`` I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier ''  Stein said .,en,en,en
`` But Arger never was able to produce it  so I cut him off my payroll '' .,en,en,en
Connection is sought,en,en,en
Other witnesses  after appearances before the jury  which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations  disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters  including Glimco and Alex .,en,en,en
The federal lawyers  according to their witnesses  also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant .,en,en,en
Under scrutiny  two of the witnesses said  were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St. .,en,en,en
The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories  liquor firms  and other businesses .,en,en,en
Lee a witness,en,en,en
Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee  director of McCormick Place ; ;,en,en,en
Jerome Leavitt  a partner in the Union Liquor company  3247 S. Kedzie Av.  Dominic Senese  a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo  onetime gang chief ; ;,en,en,en
and Frank W. Pesce  operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm  the Best Sanitation and Supply company  1215 Blue Island Av. .,en,en,en
Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick Place .,en,en,en
Stein's fee  Lee said  was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay .,en,en,en
Stein estimated this amount at `` about $1500 or $1600 a month '' .,en,en,en
A $12500 payment,en,np2,en
Leavitt  as he entered the jury room  said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for `` labor consultant work '' with five unions which organized Leavitt's workers .,en,en,en
Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local  the teamsters union  a salesman's union  the janitors' union  and a bottling workers' union .,en,en,en
Government attorneys  Leavitt said  have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans '' totaling about $40000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year .,en,en,en
All of the loans  in amounts up to $5000 each  have been repaid by Stein  according to Leavitt .,en,en,en
Stein said he needed the money  Leavitt said  to `` meet the payroll '' at National Maintenance company .,en,en,en

Curtis Allen Huff  41  of 1630 Lake Av.  Wilmette  was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association  1 S. Dearborn St.  where he formerly was employed as an attorney .,en,en,en
Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20000  altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10000 .,en,en,en
Lien payments involved,en,en,en
Huff's attorney  Antone F. Gregorio  quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff  as attorney for the loan association  in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages .,en,en,en
Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living '' .,en,en,en
Huff  who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year  said that his private practice was not lucrative .,np,en,en
Huff lives with his wife  Sue  and their four children  6 to 10 years old  in a $25000 home with a $17000 mortgage .,en,en,en
Charge lists 3 checks,en,np,en
The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber  an attorney for the association .,en,en,en
The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18 .,en,en,en
On that date  according to Gregorio  Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av. .,en,en,en
There  Gregorio said  Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense .,en,en,en
Later  Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House  using a credit card .,en,en,en

Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue  which was sold to the public during the past week .,en,en,en
For many reasons  the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous .,en,en,en
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ;,en,en,en
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell .,en,en,en
Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25  and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many .,en,en,en
In fact  very few customers  anywhere in the nation  were able to get more than 100 shares .,en,en,en
Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares  for all of their customers .,en,en,en
A measure of how hot the stock was  can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began .,en,en,en
The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share .,en,en,en
The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler  Guerin & Turner  the managing underwriter  was at $17 a share .,en,en,en
And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share .,en,en,en
But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market .,en,en,en
Indeed  from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January  the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up .,en,en,en
Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation  all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185000 to the public at $12.50  with another 5000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share ) .,en,en,en
There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering .,en,en,en
`` We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas .,en,en,en
Cable confirmation ''  it said translated .,en,en,en
But E.G.T. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares .,en,en,en
After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone .,en,en,en
But the result of it all was  E.G.T. partner Dean Guerin believes  an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation .,en,en,en
`` I feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' ''  he said  meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country .,en,en,en
He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do .,en,en,en
But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one ? ?,en,en,en
The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances .,en,en,en
First  the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months  driving stocks of all kinds up .,en,en,en
As a result  it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings  to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) .,en,en,en
Second  the `` potato chip industry '' has caught the fancy of investors lately  and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market .,en,en,en
Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months  both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at  and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up .,en,en,en
And third  the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth '' industry in the public mind of late .,en,en,en
Foods  which long had been considered `` recession resistant '' but hardly dynamic stocks  have been acting like growth stocks  going to higher price-earnings ratios .,en,en,en
The potato chip industry these days is growing  not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods  but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger .,en,en,en
The history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days .,en,en,en
Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives  men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest .,en,en,en
But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms .,en,en,en
So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock  and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito .,en,en,en
All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is .,en,en,en
Now  if Morton's newest product  a corn chip known as Chip-o's  turns out to sell as well as its stock did  the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to .,en,en,en

-- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn ''  Beryl W. Sprinkel  economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank  Chicago  predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn.  California group  conference .,en,en,en
Another speaker  William H. Draper  Jr.  former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper  Gaither & Anderson  urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more '' .,en,en,en
He urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations .,en,en,en
' not flash in pan ',en,en,en
Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern .,np,en,en
`` In view of the current expansion  which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months  but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' .,en,en,en
Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth  declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence '' .,en,en,en
Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth ''  he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery '' .,en,en,en
He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' .,en,en,en
The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 '' .,en,en,en
The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion  he said  was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike .,en,en,en
Draper declared  `` As I see it  this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today .,en,en,en
We must justify our heritage .,en,en,en
We must be ready for any needed sacrifice '' .,en,en,en
He said that from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration  that `` Russia respects our show of strength  but that presently we're not acting as we should and must '' .,en,en,en
He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action  and noted that in war `` you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do '' .,en,en,en
While he declined to suggest  how  he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro  `` for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere .,en,en,en
Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that '' .,en,en,en

-- Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery  erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks .,en,en,en
Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level '' represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average .,en,en,en

A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G. Peterson  head of one of the world's greatest camera firms  in a key address before the American Marketing Assn. .,en,en,en
However  Peterson  president of Bell & Howell  warned 800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador  that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom '' .,en,en,en
`` As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal  management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed ''  Peterson said .,en,en,en
`` With this kind of new product log-jam  the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically '' .,en,en,en
The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past  but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs .,en,en,en
Nothing to fear,en,en,en
Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas .,en,en,en
He cited  as an example  how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs  by improving its production know-how and technology .,en,en,en
He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany  with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market .,en,en,en

-- Alfred Hayes  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  said Tuesday `` there is no present need for far-reaching reforms '' which would basically alter the international financial system .,en,en,en
Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations  `` there is no reason  in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future '' .,en,en,en

-- New York Central Railroad president Alfred E. Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads merge .,en,en,en
Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger  but could possibly be an ultimate effect .,en,en,en
The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the C & O's request to control and then merge with the B & Aj .,en,en,en
`` All these kind of things weaken us ''  Perlman said .,en,en,en
Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co.  testified the B & O was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad .,en,en,en
`` The financial situation of the Baltimore & Ohio  has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s ''  he told the hearing .,en,en,en
C & O president Walter J. Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex case .,en,en,en
The New York Central also has asked the ICC to permit it to gain control of the B & Aj .,en,en,en
Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger .,en,en,en

This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing Center .,en,en,en
Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates  cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed  shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify '' .,en,en,en
The poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference .,en,en,en
It disclosed that the builders :,en,en,en
Expect their own production volume  and presumably sales  to jump 30 percent in 1961 .,en,en,en
Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1257700 non-farm housing starts .,en,en,en
The industry has said 1960 was a poor year .,en,en,en
Starts were down 20 percent from 1959 .,en,en,en
Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ?,en,en,en
Leaders of industry,en,en,en
The reason  says the Housing Center  is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen  and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders '' .,en,en,en

-- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more .,en,en,en
We sold only four pickers all last year '' .,en,en,en
Gus Ehlers  competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community  says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier .,en,en,en
`` Before then  my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% ''  he says .,en,en,en
Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business  farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas .,en,en,en
Paradoxically  the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output .,en,en,en
Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934  farmers  with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather  are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines .,en,en,en
Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently .,en,en,en
The higher price supports provided by the new legislation  together with rising prices for farm products  are pushing up farm income  making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery .,en,en,en
Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year .,en,en,en
`` In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year ''  says Mark V. Keeler  farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co. .,np,en,en
For the year to date  sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 .,en,en,en
Two of three report gains,en,en,en
Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states  two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier  with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% .,en,en,en
Not all sections are showing an upswing  however ; ;,en,en,en
the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend .,en,en,en
The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry .,en,en,en
The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally .,en,en,en
Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products .,en,en,en
More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks  buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances  chemicals and other products .,en,en,en
Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago  dealers report .,en,en,en
`` Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale ''  says Jack Martin  who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux City  Iowa .,en,en,en
`` This morning  we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2700 model .,en,en,en
Last year  we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine '' .,en,en,en
Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; ;,en,en,en
in August of 1960  he sold seven .,en,en,en
Dealers' stocks down,en,np,en
With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago  the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers .,np,en,en
For example  farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier  Mr. Keeler reports .,en,en,en
Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson  Ltd.  of Toronto in July and August rose to 2418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier  says John Staiger  vice president .,en,en,en
With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements .,en,en,en
Merritt D. Hill  Ford Motor Co. vice president  says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers .,np,en,en
Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961  retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 .,np,en,en
The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ; ;,en,en,en
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and  as a result  reduced the immediate need for machines .,en,en,en
Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects .,en,en,en
Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average  three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 .,en,en,en
The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects .,en,en,en
Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments  well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 .,en,en,en
Price support loans may total another $1 billion this year .,en,en,en
With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960  farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion  $1.5 billion above 1960's record high .,en,en,en
Net income may reach $12.7 billion  up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 .,en,en,en
The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month  reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July .,np,en,en
Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling .,en,en,en
The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined .,en,en,en
The company  in figuring its taxable earnings  deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products .,en,en,en
Such `` depletion allowances ''  in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets .,en,en,en
The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground  not to the revenue from finished products .,en,en,en
A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact  on prior-year returns still under review  for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products .,en,en,en
The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone .,en,en,en
President Kennedy  in signing the relief measure into law  stressed he regarded it as an exception .,en,en,en
`` My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries ''  the President said .,en,en,en
Charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.R.S. .,en,en,en
The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date  purpose  amount and other particulars of the contribution .,en,en,en
Requests for substantiation  the Service indicated  can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return  such as tickets to a show .,en,en,en
In such an instance  revenuers stressed  the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received .,en,en,en
A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested .,en,en,en
A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax  under Federal law  on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation .,en,en,en
Louisiana  however  collected an income tax on the profits from the sale .,en,en,en
The corporation  in filing its final Federal income return  claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense  as permitted under U.S. tax law .,en,en,en
The Revenue Service disallowed the claim  invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income .,en,en,en
The Tax Court rejected this view .,en,en,en
It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations .,en,en,en
The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subject .,en,en,en
The Service has not said what its next step will be .,en,en,en
Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency .,en,en,en
It provides that the $1800 termination payment each cadet is to get  after serving a two-year hitch without pay  will be spread over both years  not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received .,en,en,en
The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back '' to the company's advertising manager  the Tax Court ruled .,en,en,en
The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager .,en,en,en
The Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these `` kickbacks '' were not his income though they passed through his hands .,en,en,en
The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved  commenting : `` It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' .,en,en,en
A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel .,en,en,en
The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliances .,en,en,en
Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income .,en,en,en
A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls  for example  may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage .,en,en,en
She would be taxed on the pensions when received  of course  but the company's contributions would be tax-free .,en,en,en
A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement  experts warn  is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income .,en,en,en
In that event  they note  the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law .,en,en,en
Possible upshots : The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments  or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made .,en,en,en
State briefs : Voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area .,en,en,en
Colorado has a 2% sales tax .,en,en,en
Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax .,en,en,en
The Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales  made at cost to an oil company  by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent .,en,en,en
The state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales .,en,en,en
The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities .,en,en,en
-- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months  the Government reported .,en,en,en
The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April  down 1% from the March level of more than $18.2 billion .,np,en,en
April sales also were 5% below those of April last year  when volume reached a record for any month  $18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One ) .,en,en,en
The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year  two weeks earlier than in 1960  and pre-Easter buying was pushed into March .,en,en,en
Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March .,en,en,en
Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before  which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17.8 billion .,en,en,en

In private life  Miss Garson is Mrs. E. E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas  where they maintain an apartment  to their California home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos  New Mexico .,en,en,en
Therefore  her wardrobe is largely mobile  to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle .,en,en,en
Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter '' .,en,en,en
A favorite is Norman Norell  however .,en,en,en
She likes his classic chemise .,np,en,en
Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell  a black and white organdy and silk jersey .,en,en,en

So you can see that Gerald G. Ramsey  director of SMU's food services  is not the ordinary type of craven  women-trodden chef .,en,en,en
He is apt to rear back and claim his rights .,en,en,en
Ramsey  as SMU's food wrangler  buys enough groceries to serve 32000 meals a week .,en,en,en
Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden ! !,en,en,en

What does he feed his SMU football mastodons at the training table ? ?,en,en,en
`` Mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat ''  says Ramsey .,en,en,en
So he hides the mayonnaise .,en,en,en
And to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress  he bans all highly flavored condiments .,en,en,en
What do the pretty SMU girls like on their plates ? ?,en,en,en
`` Pretty much hamburger  hotdogs  steak and  at night  maybe pizza ''  says the handsome food expert .,en,en,en
`` Unfortunately  there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower '' .,en,en,en
Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman  Henry Cabot Lodge  the King of Morocco  Clement Atlee and other shiny characters .,en,en,en
Once four Tibetan monks  in their saffron robes  filed through the cafeteria line .,en,en,en
`` They aren't supposed to look at women  you know ''  Ramsey recalled .,en,en,en

Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern  many design facets  warmth  dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability .,en,en,en
That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month .,en,en,en
Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's  two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated  but warm look in contemporary .,np,en,en
These two  Heritage and Drexel  chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece  but a collection of correlated designs  each of which could stand alone .,en,en,en
The Heritage collection  to be shown by Sanger-Harris and Anderson's Studio  has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time .,en,en,en
Called Perennian  to indicate its lasting  good today and tomorrow quality  the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces .,np,en,en
Walnut  wormy chestnut  pecan  three varieties of burl  hand-woven Philippine cane  ceramic tiles  marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence  the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors  brick or paneled walls  windows that bring in the outdoors .,en,en,en
It is a collection with a custom-design look  offering simplicity with warmth  variety and vitality .,en,en,en
The Drexel collection  called Composite  to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating  a mature modern that is a variation of many designs .,en,en,en
Rounded posts give a soft  sculptured look  paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches  table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia .,en,en,en
A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving  a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end  recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest .,en,en,en
An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented  with a young  basic  functional group of chests  dressers and corner units and a canted headboard .,en,en,en
The other bedroom has heavier styling  door-fronted dressers with acacia panels  a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror .,en,en,en
Colorful  bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics  with the magenta  pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite .,en,en,en
The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles .,en,en,en
Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group  Composite .,en,en,en
The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony  to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top .,en,en,en
See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor .,en,en,en
To bring warmth to the dining area  golden orange tones are used in the fabrics .,en,en,en
Dignity and comfort  in a contemporary manner  reflecting the best aspects of today's design  with substance and maturity  keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage .,en,en,en
Center panel  hand-screened wood  actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases .,en,en,en
Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile .,en,en,en
